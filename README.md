Creating the React App

This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.

Using TailwindCSS

To use TailwindCSS in this project, we installed it as a development dependency with npm install -D tailwindcss postcss-cli autoprefixer.

State Management

To manage the application state and fetch data, we used the useEffect and useState hooks provided by React.

Flask

Flask was used for the back-end server, as it allows for quick and easy creation of web applications with minimal lines of code.

# IMPORTANT!

To make the application work, it is necessary to run Python first and then React.

If you need to change the user and the repository, you have to go to the Python file where it will be specified how to do it.
